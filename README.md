# RNN-Novel-creation
Training of a simple RNN model on Shakespearean text to generate similar text.


### To run the project
1. Run train.py to train the model
2. Run run.py to load the model and generate text


### TODO
1. Find a way to save model properly in train.py


NOTE: Since model is not saving properly, output has been shown in train.py
